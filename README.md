**FINALLY MAKING THIS REPO PUBLIC**

This is an Agent that can drive inside GTA San Andreas just by looking at the game frames. There are no other inputs. Its in a very early stage and the repo might look a little cluttered. I've also provided the trained model. Right now, it works without traffic.

# USAGE

- clone the repo
- download the model from the provided link in /model4/v0.3/saved_model/readme.txt
- open the game as explained [here in instructions](https://github.com/ParmuSingh/gtasa-driving/issues/1#issue-421833465) (basically in window mode, lowest resolution, top-left corner, bonet view and no traffic mod)
- run model4/v0.3/test_model_with_auto_straight.py in another terminal window
- press E to stop and T to pause.
- Make sure you switch to the game after starting the model. It'll take some time to start running.
